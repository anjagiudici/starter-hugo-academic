I am a Lecturer in Education at Newcastle University and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford.

My research revolves around the politics and history of education. I am particularly interested in exploring how ideological, societal, linguistic, and cultural diversity shapes how education is conceived, governed, and practiced. 

My current work focuses on the educational ideas and politics of the far right as well as on the politics of post-war education reforms more generally. Education constitutes a key means to shape a society's future. I investigate how political parties and educational stakeholders view education, and how their interactions come to shape our education systems.
